## Data Analysis with Python (FreeCodeCamp)
The following projects are submitted for the Data Analysis with Python certfication course from FreeCodeCamp.

Projects include:
1. **Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator**
  - Create a function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.
  
2. **Demographic Data Analyzer**
  - Analyze demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database using Pandas.
  
3. **Medical Data Visualizer**
  - Visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas
  
4. **Page View Time Series Visualizer**
  - Visualize time series dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots via Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. The data visualizations will help to understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
  
5. **Sea Level Predictor**
  - Predict the sea level change through year 2050 by analyzing a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880.
